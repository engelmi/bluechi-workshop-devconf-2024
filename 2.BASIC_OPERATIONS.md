# BlueChi workshop - Basic Operations

In this section we will be using `bluechictl` to control and monitor the system, but note that BlueChi provides a [DBus API](https://bluechi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/description/), thus all of the functionality is available directly on DBus or with bindings from different languages, like Python, Go and Rust.

In this section we will operate and monitor our worker nodes from the controller. Open two terminal windows, and log into the `controller` container in both of them.

```
sudo podman exec -it controller /bin/bash
```

We will use one to send commands to BlueChi, and the other one for monitoring. From time to time we will ask you to run commands in the `monitoring terminal`

## Checking node status

Make sure that both workers are online

```bash
# Check the status of all nodes
bluechictl status
# Or the status of a specific node
bluechictl status worker1
```

## Controlling service lifecycle on BlueChi nodes

The container images come preinstalled with Apache HTTP Server. Let's start it on `worker1`

```
bluechictl start worker1 httpd.service
bluechictl enable worker1 httpd.service
```

Since all the containers are configured with the host network, you can navigate to
```
http://127.0.0.1:8088/
```
to make sure that `httpd` is running.

Check the `httpd.service` status with `bluechictl`, and review the output

```
bluechictl status worker1 httpd.service
```

The following systemd lifecycle operations are available:

```
bluechictl [start|stop|freeze|thaw|reload|restart|enable|disable] <node> <service>
```

Important: BlueChi controls the services, but is not needed for them to run! You can take down all the BlueChi services, and the Apache Server will continue working:

```bash
exit
sudo podman exec -it controller systemctl stop bluechi-controller.service
sudo podman exec -it worker1 systemctl stop bluechi-agent.service
sudo podman exec -it worker2 systemctl stop bluechi-agent.service
```

Check that http://127.0.0.1:8088/ still can be accessed.

Restart all the BlueChi services:

```bash
sudo podman exec -it controller systemctl start bluechi-controller.service
sudo podman exec -it worker1 systemctl start bluechi-agent.service
sudo podman exec -it worker2 systemctl start bluechi-agent.service
sudo podman exec -it controller /bin/bash
bluechictl status
```

## Monitoring nodes

We have already seen `bluechictl status` command to show nodes status. You can use `-w` flag to continuously monitor node status. In the `monitoring terminal` run:

```
bluechictl status -w
```

Then you can log into `worker1` from another terminal, and stop `bluechi-agent.service`:

```bash
exit # in case you're logged into the controller container
sudo podman exec -it worker1 /bin/bash
systemctl stop bluechi-agent.service
```

Note that `worker1` state changed to `offline`, and the `LAST SEEN` field was updated with a timestamp.

Start back the `bluechi-agent.service` on `worker1` container and log back into `controller`

```
systemctl stop bluechi-agent.service
exit
sudo podman exec -it controller /bin/bash
```

## Monitoring services

A user can create monitors, which basically tells `bluechi-controller` to send signals on different events. In the `monitoring terminal`:

```bash
bluechictl monitor # Monitor all signals from all nodes and for all units
# or
bluechictl monitor worker1 # Monitor signals from worker1 for all units
# or
bluechictl monitor worker1 httpd.service # Monitor signals from worker1 for httpd
```

In the other terminal start and stop `httpd.service`, and review all the property change events. Also, unit status can be monitored with `status -w` command:

```
bluechictl status worker1 httpd.service -w
```
